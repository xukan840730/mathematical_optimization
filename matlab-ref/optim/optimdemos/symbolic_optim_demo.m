%% Using Symbolic Mathematics with Optimization Toolbox(TM) Solvers
%
% Optimization Toolbox(TM) solvers are usually more accurate and
% efficient when you supply gradients and Hessians of the
% objective and constraint functions. This demo shows how to use
% the Symbolic Math Toolbox(TM) functions named |jacobian| and
% |matlabFunction| to provide these derivatives to optimization
% solvers.
%
% *Additional Requirements:*
%
% * Symbolic Math Toolbox
%
% There are several considerations in using symbolic
% calculations with optimization functions:
%
% 1. Optimization objective and constraint functions should be
% defined in terms of a vector, say |x|. However, symbolic
% variables are scalar or complex-valued, not vector-valued.
% This requires you to translate between vectors and scalars.
%
% 2. Optimization gradients, and sometimes Hessians, are
% supposed to be calculated within the body of the objective or
% constraint functions. This means that a symbolic gradient or
% Hessian has to be placed in the appropriate place in the
% objective or constraint function file or function handle.
%
% 3. Calculating gradients and Hessians symbolically can be
% time-consuming. Therefore you should perform this calculation
% only once, and generate code, via |matlabFunction|, to call
% during execution of the solver.
%
% 4. Evaluating symbolic expressions with the |subs| function is
% time-consuming. It is much more efficient to use
% |matlabFunction|.
%
% 5. |matlabFunction| generates code that depends on the
% orientation of input vectors. Since |fmincon| calls the
% objective function with column vectors, you must be careful to
% call |matlabFunction| with column vectors of symbolic
% variables.

%% First Example: Unconstrained Minimization with Hessian
%
% The objective function to minimize is:
%
% $$f(x_1, x_2) = \log\left (1 + 3 \left ( x_2 - (x_1^3 - x_1)
% \right )^2 + (x_1 - 4/3)^2 \right ).$$
%
% This function is positive, with a unique minimum value of zero
% attained at |x1| = 4/3, |x2| =(4/3)^3 - 4/3 = 1.0370...
%
% We write the independent variables as |x1| and |x2| because in
% this form they can be used as symbolic variables. As
% components of a vector |x| they would be written |x(1)| and
% |x(2)|. The function has a twisty valley as depicted in the
% plot below.

syms x1 x2 real
x = [x1;x2]; % column vector of symbolic variables
f = log(1 + 3*(x2 - (x1^3 - x1))^2 + (x1 - 4/3)^2);

ezsurfc(f,[-2 2])
view(127,38)

%%
% Compute the gradient and Hessian of f:

gradf = jacobian(f,x).'; % column gradf
hessf = jacobian(gradf,x);

%%
% The |fminunc| solver expects to pass in a vector x, and, with
% the |GradObj| and |Hessian| options set to 'on', expects a
% list of three outputs: [f(x),gradf(x),hessf(x)]
%
% |matlabFunction| generates exactly this list of three outputs
% from a list of three inputs. Furthermore, using the |vars|
% option, |matlabFunction| accepts vector inputs.

fh = matlabFunction(f,gradf,hessf,'vars',{x});

%%
% Now solve the minimization problem starting at the point
% [-1,2]:

options = optimset('GradObj','on','Hessian','on', ...
    'Display','final');
[xfinal fval exitflag output] = fminunc(fh,[-1;2],options)

%%
% Compare this with the number of iterations using no gradient
% or Hessian information. This requires the medium-scale
% algorithm, obtained by setting the |LargeScale| option to
% |'off'|:

options = optimset('Display','final','LargeScale','off');
fh2 = matlabFunction(f,'vars',{x}); 
% fh2 = objective with no gradient or Hessian
[xfinal fval exitflag output2] = fminunc(fh2,[-1;2],options)

%%
% The number of iterations is lower when using gradients and
% Hessians, and there are dramatically fewer function
% evaluations:

sprintf(['There were %d iterations using gradient' ...
    ' and Hessian, but %d without them.'], ...
    output.iterations,output2.iterations)
sprintf(['There were %d function evaluations using gradient' ...
    ' and Hessian, but %d without them.'], ...
    output.funcCount,output2.funcCount)

%% Second Example: Constrained Minimization Using the fmincon Interior-Point Algorithm
%
% We consider the same objective function and starting point,
% but now have two nonlinear constraints:
%
% $$5\sinh(x_2/5) \ge x_1^4$$
%
% $$5\tanh(x_1/5) \ge x_2^2 - 1.$$
%
% The constraints keep the optimization away from the global
% minimum point [1.333,1.037]. Visualize the two constraints:

[X,Y] = meshgrid(-2:.01:3);
Z = (5*sinh(Y./5) >= X.^4); 
% Z=1 where the first constraint is satisfied, Z=0 otherwise
Z = Z+ 2*(5*tanh(X./5) >= Y.^2 - 1); 
% Z=2 where the second is satisfied, Z=3 where both are
surf(X,Y,Z,'LineStyle','none');
set(gcf,'Color','w') % white background
view(0,90)
hold on
plot3(.4396, .0373, 4,'o','MarkerEdgeColor','r','MarkerSize',8); 
% best point
xlabel('x');ylabel('y');
hold off

%%
% We plotted a small red circle around the optimal point.
%
% Here is a plot of the objective function over the feasible
% region, the region that satisfies both constraints, pictured
% above in dark red, along with a small red circle around the
% optimal point:

W = log(1 + 3*(Y - (X.^3 - X)).^2 + (X - 4/3).^2); 
% W = the objective function
W(Z < 3) = nan; % plot only where the constraints are satisfied
surf(X,Y,W,'LineStyle','none');
view(68,20)
hold on
plot3(.4396, .0373, .8152,'o','MarkerEdgeColor','r', ...
    'MarkerSize',8); % best point
xlabel('x');ylabel('y');zlabel('z');
hold off

%%
% The nonlinear constraints must be written in the form |c(x)
% <= 0|. We compute all the symbolic constraints and their
% derivatives, and placethem in a function handle using
% |matlabFunction|.
%
% The gradients of the constraints should be column vectors;
% they must beplaced in the objective function as a matrix, with
% each column of the matrix representing the gradient of one
% constraint function. This is the transpose of the form
% generated by |jacobian|, so we take the transpose below.
%
% We place the nonlinear constraints into a function handle.
% |fmincon| expects the nonlinear constraints and gradients to
% be output in the order [c ceq gradc gradceq]. Since there are
% no nonlinear equality constraints,we output [ ] for |ceq| and
% |gradceq|.

c1 = x1^4 - 5*sinh(x2/5);
c2 = x2^2 - 5*tanh(x1/5) - 1;
c = [c1 c2];
gradc = jacobian(c,x).'; % transpose to put in correct form
constraint = matlabFunction(c,[],gradc,[],'vars',{x});

%%
% The interior-point algorithm requires its Hessian function to
% be written as a separate function, instead of being part of
% the objective function. This is because a nonlinearly
% constrained function needs to include those constraints in its
% Hessian. Its Hessian is the Hessian of the Lagrangian; see the
% User's Guide for more information.
%
% The Hessian function takes two input arguments: the position
% vector |x|, and the Lagrange multiplier structure lambda. The
% parts of the lambda structure that you use for nonlinear
% constraints are |lambda.ineqnonlin| and |lambda.eqnonlin|. For
% the current constraint, there are no linear equalities, so we
% use the two multipliers |lambda.ineqnonlin(1)| and
% |lambda.ineqnonlin(2)|.
%
% We calculated the Hessian of the objective function in the
% first example. Now we calculate the Hessians of the two
% constraint functions, and make function handle versions with
% |matlabFunction|.

hessc1 = jacobian(gradc(:,1),x); % constraint = first c column
hessc2 = jacobian(gradc(:,2),x);

hessfh = matlabFunction(hessf,'vars',{x});
hessc1h = matlabFunction(hessc1,'vars',{x});
hessc2h = matlabFunction(hessc2,'vars',{x});

%%
% To make the final Hessian, we put the three Hessians together,
% adding the appropriate Lagrange multipliers to the constraint
% functions.

myhess = @(x,lambda)(hessfh(x) + ...
    lambda.ineqnonlin(1)*hessc1h(x) + ...
    lambda.ineqnonlin(2)*hessc2h(x));

%%
% Set the options to use the interior-point algorithm, the
% gradient, and the Hessian, have the objective function return
% both the objective and the gradient, and run the solver:

options = optimset('Algorithm','interior-point','GradObj',...
    'on','GradConstr','on','Hessian','user-supplied',...
    'HessFcn',myhess,'Display','final');
% fh2 = objective without Hessian
fh2 = matlabFunction(f,gradf,'vars',{x});
[xfinal fval exitflag output] = fmincon(fh2,[-1;2],...
    [],[],[],[],[],[],constraint,options)
%%
% Again, the solver makes many fewer iterations and function
% evaluations with gradient and Hessian supplied than when they
% are not:

options = optimset('Algorithm','interior-point',...
    'Display','final');
% fh3 = objective without gradient or Hessian
fh3 = matlabFunction(f,'vars',{x});
% constraint without gradient:
constraint = matlabFunction(c,[],'vars',{x});
[xfinal fval exitflag output2] = fmincon(fh3,[-1;2],...
    [],[],[],[],[],[],constraint,options)

sprintf(['There were %d iterations using gradient' ...
    ' and Hessian, but %d without them.'],...
    output.iterations,output2.iterations)
sprintf(['There were %d function evaluations using gradient' ...
    ' and Hessian, but %d without them.'], ...
    output.funcCount,output2.funcCount)

%% Cleaning Up Symbolic Variables
%
% The symbolic variables used in this demo were assumed to be
% real. To clear this assumption from the symbolic engine
% workspace, it is not sufficient to delete the variables. You
% must either clear the variables using the syntax

syms x1 x2 clear

%%
% or reset the symbolic engine using the command
%
%  % reset(symengine) % uncomment this line to reset the engine
%
% After resetting the symbolic engine you should clear all
% symbolic variables from the MATLAB(R) workspace:
%
%  % clear % uncomment this line to clear the variables
