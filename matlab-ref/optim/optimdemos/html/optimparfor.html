         <h1>Minimizing an Expensive Optimization Problem Using Parallel Computing Toolbox&#8482;</h1>
         <!--introduction-->
         <p>This is a demonstration of how to speedup the minimization of an expensive optimization problem using functions in Optimization
            Toolbox&#8482; and Global Optimization Toolbox. In the first part of the demo we will solve the optimization problem
            by evaluating functions in a serial fashion and in the second part of the demo we will solve the same problem using the parallel
            for loop (PARFOR) feature by evaluating functions in parallel. We will compare the time taken by the optimization function
            in both cases.
         </p>

         <p>For the purpose of this demo, we solve a problem in four variables, where the objective and constraint functions are made
            artificially expensive by having them compute the eigenvalues of a large matrix.

         <p>Since GA usually takes more function evaluations than FMINCON we will remove the expensive constraint from this problem and
            perform unconstrained optimization instead; we pass empty ([]) for constraints. In addition, we limit the maximum generations
            to 15 for GA so that GA can terminate in a reasonable amount of time. We are interested in measuring the time taken by GA
            so that we can compare it to the parallel GA evaluation.

            solvers in Global Optimization Toolbox evaluate functions in parallel. To use the PARFOR feature, we can use
            the MATLABPOOL function to setup the parallel environment. MATLABPOOL will start four MATLAB&reg; workers on the local machine
            by default. The computer on which this demo is published has two cores so we will start only two workers. Also, note that
            if MATLABPOOL is already open we will get an error trying to open again; see documentation for MATLABPOOL for more information.

%% Minimizing an Expensive Optimization Problem Using Parallel Computing Toolbox(TM)
% This is a demonstration of how to speedup the minimization of an
% expensive optimization problem using functions in Optimization Toolbox(TM)
% and Global Optimization Toolbox. In the first part of 
% the demo we will solve the optimization problem by evaluating functions 
% in a serial fashion and in the second part of the demo we will solve the 
% same problem using the parallel for loop (PARFOR) feature by evaluating 
% functions in parallel. We will compare the time taken by the optimization
% function in both cases.

%% Expensive Optimization Problem
% For the purpose of this demo, we solve a problem in four variables, where
% the objective and constraint functions are made artificially expensive by
% having them compute the eigenvalues of a large matrix.
type expensive_objfun.m
type expensive_confun.m

%%
% We can measure the approximate time taken by the objective function and
% the constraint function to evaluate a point. This can give us an
% estimate of total time taken to minimize the problem. 
startTime = tic;
for i = 1:10
    expensive_objfun(rand(1,4));
end
stopTime = toc(startTime);
averageTime = stopTime/10;
fprintf('Objective function evaluation: %g seconds.\n', averageTime);

startTime = tic;
for i = 1:10
    expensive_confun(rand(1,4));
end
stopTime = toc(startTime);
averageTime = stopTime/10;
fprintf('Constraint function evaluation: %g seconds.\n',averageTime);

%% Minimizing Using FMINCON
% We are interested in measuring the time taken by FMINCON so that we can
% compare it to the parallel FMINCON evaluation.
startPoint = [1 -2 0 5];
options = optimset('Display','iter','Algorithm','active-set');
startTime = tic;
fmincon(@expensive_objfun,startPoint,[],[],[],[],[],[],@expensive_confun,options);
time_fmincon_sequential = toc(startTime);
fprintf('Serial FMINCON optimization takes %g seconds.\n',time_fmincon_sequential);

%% Minimizing Using Genetic Algorithm
% Since GA usually takes more function evaluations than FMINCON we will
% remove the expensive constraint from this problem and perform
% unconstrained optimization instead; we pass empty ([]) for constraints.
% In addition, we limit the maximum generations to 15 for GA so that GA can
% terminate in a reasonable amount of time. We are interested in measuring
% the time taken by GA so that we can compare it to the parallel GA
% evaluation.
nvar = 4;
gaoptions = gaoptimset('Generations',15,'Display','iter');
startTime = tic;
ga(@expensive_objfun,nvar,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],gaoptions);
time_ga_sequential = toc(startTime);
fprintf('Serial GA optimization takes %g seconds.\n',time_ga_sequential);

%% Setting Parallel Computing Toolbox
% The finite differencing used by the functions in Optimization Toolbox to
% approximate derivatives is done in parallel using the PARFOR feature if
% Parallel Computing Toolbox is available and MATLABPOOL is running.
% Similarly, GA, GAMULTIOBJ, and PATTERNSEARCH solvers in Global Optimization 
% Toolbox evaluate functions in parallel. To use the PARFOR feature, we can 
% use the MATLABPOOL function to setup the parallel environment. MATLABPOOL 
% will start four MATLAB(R) workers on the local machine by default. The 
% computer on which this demo is published has two cores so we will start 
% only two workers. Also, note that if MATLABPOOL is already open we will 
% get an error trying to open again; see documentation for MATLABPOOL for 
% more information.
matlabpool open 2

%% Minimizing Using Parallel FMINCON
% To minimize our expensive optimization problem using the parallel FMINCON
% function, we need to explicitly indicate that our objective and
% constraint functions can be evaluated in parallel and that we want
% FMINCON to use its parallel functionality wherever possible. Currently,
% finite differencing can be done in parallel. We are interested in
% measuring the time taken by FMINCON so that we can compare
% it to the serial FMINCON run.
options = optimset(options,'UseParallel','always');
startTime = tic;
fmincon(@expensive_objfun,startPoint,[],[],[],[],[],[],@expensive_confun,options);
time_fmincon_parallel = toc(startTime);
fprintf('Parallel FMINCON optimization takes %g seconds.\n',time_fmincon_parallel);

%% Minimizing Using Parallel Genetic Algorithm
% To minimize our expensive optimization problem using the GA function, we
% need to explicitly indicate that our objective function can be evaluated
% in parallel and that we want GA to use its parallel functionality
% wherever possible. To use the parallel GA we also require that the
% 'Vectorized' option be set to the default (i.e., 'off'). We are again
% interested in measuring the time taken by GA so that we can compare it to
% the serial GA run. Though this run may be different from the serial one because
% GA uses a random number generator, the number of expensive function evaluations 
% is the same in both runs.
gaoptions = gaoptimset(gaoptions,'UseParallel','always');
startTime = tic;
ga(@expensive_objfun,nvar,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],gaoptions);
time_ga_parallel = toc(startTime);
fprintf('Parallel GA optimization takes %g seconds.\n',time_ga_parallel);

%%
% Utilizing parallel function evaluation via PARFOR improved the efficiency
% of both FMINCON and GA. The improvement is typically better for expensive
% objective and constraint functions. Also, using more than two workers
% and/or using dedicated clusters with MATLABPOOL gives better performance.
% At last we close the parallel environment by calling MATLABPOOL.
