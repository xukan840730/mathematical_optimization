function [pks,frqs] = findpeaks(this,varargin)
%FINDPEAKS Find local peaks in data
%   PKS = FINDPEAKS(H) finds local peaks in data contained in the DSPDATA
%   object H.
%
%   [PKS,FRQS]= FINDPEAKS(H) also returns the frequencies FRQS at which the
%   PKS occur.
%
%   [...] = FINDPEAKS(H,'MINPEAKHEIGHT',MPH) finds only those peaks that
%   are greater than MINPEAKHEIGHT MPH. Specifying MPH may help in reducing
%   the processing time. MPH is a real valued scalar. The default value of
%   MPH is -Inf.  
%
%   [...] = FINDPEAKS(H,'MINPEAKDISTANCE',MPD) finds peaks that are at
%   least separated by MINPEAKDISTANCE MPD. MPD is a real valued positive
%   scalar specified in frequency units. This parameter may be specified to
%   ignore smaller peaks that may occur in close proximity to a large local
%   peak. For example, if a large local peak occurs at frequency Fp, then
%   all smaller peaks in the range (Fp-MPD, Fp+MPD) are ignored. If not
%   specified, MPD is assigned a value equal to the minimum distance
%   between two consecutive frequency points in the spectrum estimate.
%
%   [...] = FINDPEAKS(H,'THRESHOLD',TH) finds peaks that are at least
%   greater than their neighbhors by the THRESHOLD TH. TH is real valued
%   scalar greater than or equal to zero. The default value of TH is zero.
%
%   [...] = FINDPEAKS(H,'NPEAKS',NP) specifies the number of peaks to be
%   found. NP is an integer greater than zero. When specified, the
%   procedure terminates once NP peaks are found and the NP peaks are
%   returned. If not specified, all peaks are returned.
%
%   [...] = FINDPEAKS(H,'SORTSTR',STR) specifies the direction of sorting
%   of peaks. STR can take values of 'ascend','descend' or 'none'. If not
%   specified, STR takes the value of 'none' and the peaks are returned in
%   the order of their occurrence.

%   EXAMPLE
%      f1  = 0.5; f2 = 0.52; f3 = 0.9; f4 = 0.1; n = 0:255; 
%      x   = 10*cos(pi*f1*n)'+ 6*cos(pi*f2*n)'+ 0.5*cos(pi*f3*n)'+ ...
%            + 0.5*cos(pi*f4*n)';
%      H   = spectrum.periodogram;
%      h   = msspectrum(H,x); 
%      pks = findpeaks(h);
%
%      % To ignore peaks below 0.1 
%      [pks, frqs] = findpeaks(h,'MinPeakHeight',0.1);
