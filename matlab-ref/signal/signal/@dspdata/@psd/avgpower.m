        % There are two cases when spectrum is twosided, CenterDC or not.
        % In both cases, the frequency samples does not cover the entire
        % 2*pi (or Fs) region due to the periodicity.  Therefore, the
        % missing freq range has to be compensated in the integral.  The
        % missing freq range can be calculated as the difference between
        % 2*pi (or Fs) and the actual frequency vector span.  For example,
        % considering 1024 points over 2*pi, then frequency vector will be
        % [0 2*pi*(1-1/1024)], i.e., the missing freq range is 2*pi/1024.
        %
        % When CenterDC is true, if the number of points is even, the
        % Nyquist point (Fs/2) is exact, therefore, the missing range is at
        % the left side, i.e., the beginning of the vector.  If the number
        % of points is odd, then the missing freq range is at both ends.
        % However, due to the symmetry of the real signal spectrum, it can
        % still be considered as if it is missing at the beginning of the
        % vector.  Even when the spectrum is asymmetric, since the
        % approximation of the integral is close when NFFT is large,
        % putting it in the beginning of the vector is still ok.
        %
        % When CenterDC is false, the missing range is always at the end of
        % the frequency vector since the frequency always starts at 0.
