function filterType_listener(h,d)
%FILTERTYPE_LISTENER Callback for type specific actions.
%   This function is executed when a particular filter type is
%   selected in the design object. In most cases nothing needs to
%   be done, so by default this function is a no-op. However,
%   this function can be overloaded if a particular type needs to
%   do some extra work as soons as it is selected.
