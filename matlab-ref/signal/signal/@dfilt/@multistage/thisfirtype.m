function filtertype = thisfirtype(Hd)
%FIRTYPE  Determine the type (1-4) of a linear phase FIR filter.
%   T = FIRTYPE(Hd) determines the type (1 through 4) of an FIR filter
%   object Hd.  The filter must be real and have linear phase.
%
%   Type 1 through 4 are defines as follows:
%      
%     - Type 1: Even order symmetric coefficients.
%     - Type 2: Odd order symmetric coefficients.
%     - Type 3: Even order antisymmetric coefficients.
%     - Type 4: Odd order antisymmetric coefficients.
%
%   If Hd has multiple sections, all sections must be real FIR filters with
%   linear phase.  For this case, T is a cell array containing the type
%   of each section.

% The FIR type is based on the impulse response.  For direct-form FIR
% filters, this is just the numerator coefficients.  However, for other FIR
% filters, such as lattice-ma, the impulse response has a complicated
% relationship to the coefficients, and so impz is the best for all cases.
