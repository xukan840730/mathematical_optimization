function h = bpcutoff(varargin)
%BPCUTOFF   Construct a BPCUTOFF object.
%   H = BPCUTOFF(N,Fcutoff1,Fcutoff2,Fs) constructs a bandpass filter
%   specifications object with cutoff frequencies.
%
%   N is the filter order and must be an even positive integer.
%
%   Fcutoff1 is the lower cutoff frequency and must be a positive scalar
%   between 0 and 1 if no sampling frequency is specified or between 0 and
%   Fs/2 if a sampling frequency Fs is specified.
%
%   Fcutoff2 is the higher cutoff frequency and must be a positive scalar
%   between 0 and 1 if no sampling frequency is specified or between 0 and
%   Fs/2 if a sampling frequency Fs is specified.
%
%   Fs is the sampling frequency. If Fs is not specified, normalized
%   frequency is assumed. If Fs is specified, it must be a positive scalar.
