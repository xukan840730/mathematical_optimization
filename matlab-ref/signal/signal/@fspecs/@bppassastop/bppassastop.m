function h = bppassastop(varargin)
%BPPASSASTOP   Construct a BPPASSASTOP object.
%   H = BPPASSASTOP(N,Fpass1,Fpass2,Astop1,Apass,Astop2,Fs) constructs a
%   bandpass filter specifications object with passband-edge specifications
%   and stopband attenuation.
%
%   N is the filter order and must be an even positive integer.
%
%   Fpass1 is the lower passband-edge frequency and must be a positive
%   scalar between 0 and 1 if no sampling frequency is specified or between
%   0 and Fs/2 if a sampling frequency Fs is specified.
%
%   Fpass2 is the higher passband-edge frequency and must be a positive
%   scalar larger than Fpass1 and between 0 and 1 if no sampling frequency
%   is specified or between 0 and Fs/2 if a sampling frequency Fs is
%   specified.
%
%   Astop1 is the minimum lower-stopband attenuation in dB. It must be a
%   positive scalar.
%
%   Apass is the maximum passband deviation in dB. It must be a positive
%   scalar.
%
%   Astop2 is the minimum higher-stopband attenuation in dB. It must be a
%   positive scalar.
%
%   Fs is the sampling frequency. If Fs is not specified, normalized
%   frequency is assumed. If Fs is specified, it must be a positive scalar.
