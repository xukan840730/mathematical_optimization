%% Filtering without Initial Conditions
% By default, the states of the filter, stored in the 'States' property,
% are each initialized to zero. Furthermore the 'PersistentMemory' property
% is false which means that the object is reset before the filter is run.
% This allows to filter the same sequence twice and produce the same
% output.
f     = fdesign.lowpass('N,F3dB',5,.5);
hsos  = design(f,'butter');   % 5th-order IIR filter
hdf1  = convert(hsos,'df1');  % Direct-form I implementation
hdf1t = convert(hdf1,'df1t'); % Transposed direct-form I implementation
hdf2  = convert(hdf1,'df2t'); % Direct-form II implementation

x = ones(5,1);
y1 = filter(hdf1, x)
%%
y2 = filter(hdf1, x) 

%% Specifying Initial Conditions
% The user can specify initial conditions by turning the
% 'PersistentMemory' property true and setting the 'States' property.
% If a scalar is specified, it will be expanded to the correct number of
% states. If a vector is specified, its length must be equal to the number
% of states. For example:

x = randn(99,1);

hdf1.PersistentMemory = true;
hdf1.States = 1; % Uses scalar expansion
ydf1 = filter(hdf1,x);

hdf1t.PersistentMemory = true;
hdf1t.States = 1; % Uses scalar expansion
ydf1t = filter(hdf1t,x);

stem([ydf1, ydf1t]);
legend('Direct-Form I', 'Direct-Form I Transposed',0)
xlabel('Samples'); ylabel('Output of the filter')

%%
% Notice how the two filtered sequences are different at the beginning.
% This is due to the initial conditions. Since the filter structures are
% different, the effect of the initial conditions on the output is
% different. As the effect of the initial conditions dies out, the two
% sequences become the same.

%% Streaming Data
% Setting the 'PersistentMemory' property true is a convenient feature
% for streaming data to the filter. Breaking up a signal and filtering in a
% loop is equivalent to filtering the entire signal at once: 

close
hdf1.States = 1;  
xsec     = reshape(x(:),33,3); % Breaking the signal in 3 sections
ydf1loop = zeros(size(xsec));  % Pre-allocate memory
for i=1:3,
    ydf1loop(:,i) = filter(hdf1,xsec(:,i));
end
%%
% We verify that ydf1loop(signal filtered by sections) is equal to ydf1
% (entire signal filtered at once).
max(abs(ydf1loop(:)-ydf1))

%% Multi-Channel Signals
% If the input signal x is a matrix, each column of x is seen by the filter
% as an independent channel.
x = randn(10,3); % 3-channels signal
y = filter(hdf2,x)
%%
states = hdf2.States
%%
% Notice that the object stores the final conditions of the filter for each
% channel, each column of the 'States' property corresponding to one
% channel.

%% Working with Second-Order Sections
% From a numerical accuracy standpoint, it is usually preferable to work
% with IIR filters in second-order sections (SOS) form and avoid forming
% the transfer function. FDESIGN objects design IIR filters in SOS form by
% default and DFILT objects provide fine-tuned analysis algorithms for SOS
% filters that avoid the numerical problems associated with transfer
% functions.

f    = fdesign.lowpass('N,F3dB',30,.5);
hsos = design(f,'butter');

%%
% First we will illustrate the problem of working with transfer functions
% for analysis purposes.  All zeros are supposed to be at z = -1.
[b,a] = tf(hsos);
hfvt  = fvtool(b,a, 'Analysis', 'polezero');  
set(hfvt, 'Color', [1 1 1])
%%
% Now we compare to using SOS DFILT objects. We use df2sos in this example
% but df1sos, df1tsos and df2tsos are also available.

set(hfvt, 'Filter', hsos); % All zeros are where they should be

%% Filtering with Second-Order Sections
% In addition to improved analysis, filtering should also be performed
% using second-order sections. In the example below we compare filtering
% using the transfer function with filtering using SOS. The transfer
% function filter is actually unstable. You can see this in the plot by
% looking at the output of this filter (in blue). The output begins to grow
% without bound, a symptom of instability. In contrast, the output of the
% SOS filter (in green) remains bounded.

f       = fdesign.lowpass('N,Fp,Ap,Ast',30,.4,.1,60);
hdf2sos = design(f,'ellip','FilterStructure','df2sos');
hdf2    = convert(hdf2sos,'df2'); % Direct-form II implementation of filter

x       = randn(120,1);
ydf2    = filter(hdf2,x);     % Filter a random signal using direct-form II
ydf2sos = filter(hdf2sos,x);  % Filter the same signal using SOS

stem([ydf2, ydf2sos])         % Result should be the same, but it isn't
set(gcf, 'Color', [1 1 1]);
xlabel('Samples'); ylabel('Output of the filter')
legend('Direct-Form II', 'Direct-Form II, Second-Order Sections',0)

%% Other Filter Structures
% In addition to direct-form filters and corresponding SOS filters, DFILT
% objects can simulate other filter structures.
%
% FIR lattice structures usually arise in the context of linear prediction.
% If the lattice coefficients (also called reflection coefficients) are all
% less than one in magnitude, we can implement either a minimum-phase or a
% maximum-phase FIR filter.

close
k    = [.1;.2;.3;.4];
hmin = dfilt.latticemamin(k); % Minimum-phase FIR filter
hmax = dfilt.latticemamax(k); % Maximum-phase FIR filter
set(hfvt, 'Filter', [hmin, hmax]);  

%% 
% Other filter structures available are allpass and ARMA lattices and
% state-space structures.

hallpass  = dfilt.latticeallpass(k);   % Allpass lattice filter
v         = 1:5;
harma     = dfilt.latticearma(k,v);    % ARMA lattice filter
[A,B,C,D] = ss(harma);                 % State-space model of ARMA lattice
hss       = dfilt.statespace(A,B,C,D); % State-space filter
