chapter:
motion capture -> animation data.

animation data compression: ice compression.

it's very highly compressed, which is good for data wise but we have to build anim cmd to animate skeleton at some time.
it uses to be done on spu, and it's done on gpu compute context.(is that correct?)

however, to get custom information from anim, such as align, ankle loc by animate the character will be very expensive. so we simply supports export any number of locators any time.
It will be used to export align location, apRef locator, ankle locators, hand touch, etc.

ApRef Locator, how that work? (Need ask Kurt how design and animator align apLoc in Maya?)

Gesture: (Need talk to Vish, multiple directions of partial and additives which supports character looks/faces/aims to a direction)

IK: simple introduction of full body Ik. It's basically a mathematical optimization. Solve Jacobian matrix is very popular,
